# Mobile-Price-Prediction
In this Project,On the basis of the mobile Specification like Battery power, 3G enabled , wifi ,Bluetooth, Ram etc we are predicting Price range of the mobile.

Conclusion

From EDA we can see that there are mobile phones in 4 price ranges.

The number of elements is almost similar. half the devices have Bluetooth, and half donâ€™t

There is a gradual increase in battery as the price range increases Ram has continuous increase with price range while moving from Low cost to Very high cost

Costly phones are lighter

RAM, battery power, pixels played more significant role in deciding the price range of mobile phone.

From all the above experiments we can conclude that logistic regression and, XGboosting with using hyperparameters we got the best results.
